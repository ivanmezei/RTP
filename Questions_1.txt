Lecture questions Part1

L0 Introduction

1. Explain basic blocks of Von Neumann model of microcomputer.
2. What additional components are present in microntrollers and embedded systems compared to Von Neumann model?
3. Explain microcomputer architectures based on memory organization.
4. CISC vs RISC. Explain both and compare.

L1 Architecture basics

1. Name and briefly describe hardware components of CPU.
2. What is memory hierarchy and how is it influenced by different memory technologies?
3. What is temporal and what is spatial locality? Why is it important with respect to a memory hierarchy?
4. What types of registers exist? Explain the purpose of PC, IR, SP and SR(PSW).
5. Let A=0x9A and B=0x4C. After addition of A and B, calculate C (carry), N (negative), Z(zero), V(oVerflaw) flags.
6. What is stack and how is it used? Provide simple example.
7. What is control unit (CU) and what implementation of CU exist? Briefly describe each of them.
8. What is the basic instruction execution cycle? Show diagram of the fetch execute cycle with and without the interrupt subsystem present.

L2 Arduino intro

1. Why is Arduino successful mashup?
2. Name at least 4 alternative functions of pins.
3. Explain the purpose and functioning of the bootloader.
4. List the inside hardware modules of ATMega328p.
5. Explain the purpose of setup() and loop() functions in Arduino IDE.

L3 ATMega328p internals

1. ATMega328p memories (which kind, capacity, purpose).
2. ATMega328p ports (names, widths, purpose).
3. Which SFRs are used for working with I/O ports?
4. Explain IN/OUT GPIO sheme.
5. Which serial communication modules are available in ATMega328p, and what protocols are used?
6. Explain PWM (timing, purpose, usage examples).
7. Successive aproximation register A/D conversion (simplified block sheme and explanation of functioning)

L4 Peripherals

1. Name ways to connect peripherals with microcontrollers.
2. Direct interfacing (pros/cons, examples).
3. Explain increasing fan-out by buffers.
4. Explain current/voltage shock protection by buffers.
5. Explain temporarily memorization of, e.g. addresses, using buffers.
6. Explain different classes of buffers.
7. Explain time multiplexing and give an example.
8. External memory interfacing.
9. Explain memory mapped interfacing.
10.How would you: 1. change some bits of byte to zero 2. change some bits of byte to one 3. toggle some bits of byte (give examples)?
